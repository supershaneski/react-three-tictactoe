react-three-tictactoe
===========

This is a simple implementation of `tic-tac-toe` game using [three.js](https://threejs.org) in `React` application.

`Player 1` is human while `Player 2` is computer. Currently, `Player 2` just pick move randomly.

# Motivation

Basically, this is just a coding exercise to get familiar with using `three.js` in `React`.

I will be using the following modules to help implement `three.js` in `React`:

* [@react-three/fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber#readme), a `React renderer` for `three.js`.
  
* [@react-three/drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei), collection of helpers for `@react-three/fiber`.
  
* [@react-spring/three](https://github.com/pmdrs/react-spring#readme), a spring-physics animation library.

The tic-tac-toe game logic is based from the `React` [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
